C Programming----

Intro-
       What is C? =
       very popular language.
       general-purpose programming language.
       created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
       fundamental language in the field of computer science.
       C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

       Why Learn C? =
       most popular programming language in the world.
       as the syntax is similar to other languages.
       very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.
       C is very versatile(used in both applications and technologies).

       Difference between C and C++ =
       C++ was developed as an extension of C (both languages have almost the same syntax).
       C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

C Get Started-
              Get Started With C =
               you need two things:A text editor, like Notepad.
                                   A compiler, like GCC (to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand).

C Syntax- 
          Syntax =
          Example[#include <stdio.h> --header file library(always appears in your program),Header files add functionality to C programs.
                  blank line --C compiler ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
                  main() --It is a function(always appear in a C program), Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
                  printf()-- is a function used to output/print text to the screen.
                  ;(semicolon)-- Every C statement ends with a ;
          The body of int main() could also been written as:
                      int main(){printf("Hello World!");return 0;}

          Statements =
          A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer,these programming instructions are called "statements".
          Many Statements(Example).

C Output-
          Print Text =
          Exapmle, Double Quotes, Many printf Functions.

          New Lines =
          \n(newline character)-- It forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.
          escape sequences("\n","\t","\\","\"").

C Comments-
            It can be used to explain code
            It make code more readable.
            It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
            type -- singled-lined(//) or multi-lined(/**/).

C Variables-
             Create Variable =
             Variables are containers for storing data values.
             like--int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
                  float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
                  char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
             Declaring (Creating) Variables-
                 Syntax-- type variableName = value;  ,Example.

            Format Specifiers=
            format specifiers surrounded by double quotes (""), inside the printf() function,(like-%d).
            use to tell the compiler what type of data variable is storing. It is basically a placeholder for the variable value. 
            %d(int),  %c(char), %f(float).

           Change Values =
           assigning a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value(Example).
           Add Variables Together.

           Multiple Variables =
           Declare Multiple Variables--To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list.
           also assign the same value to multiple variables of the same type(x = y = z = 50;).

          Variable Names=
          variables must be identified with unique names, these unique names are called identifiers.
          Identifiers(like x, y, age, sum, totalVolume).
          The general rules for naming variables are:
                            Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
                            Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
                            Names are case sensitive
                            Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
                            Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names
          Real-Life Example =
          stores different data of a college student, Calculate the Area of a Rectangle.

Data Types-
            Basic Data Types =
            The data type specifies size and type of information the variable will store.
            [int(2 or 4 bytes), float(4 bytes, store 6-7 decimal digits), double(8 bytes,Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits),char(1 byte).
            Basic Format Specifiers =
            int(%d or %i), float(%f or %F), double(%lf), char(%c), strings(%s)

            Decimal Precision =
            Set Decimal Precision
