C Programming----

Intro-
       What is C? =
       very popular language.
       general-purpose programming language.
       created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
       fundamental language in the field of computer science.
       C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

       Why Learn C? =
       most popular programming language in the world.
       as the syntax is similar to other languages.
       very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.
       C is very versatile(used in both applications and technologies).

       Difference between C and C++ =
       C++ was developed as an extension of C (both languages have almost the same syntax).
       C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

C Get Started-
              Get Started With C =
               you need two things:A text editor, like Notepad.
                                   A compiler, like GCC (to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand).

C Syntax- 
          Syntax =
          Example[#include <stdio.h> --header file library(always appears in your program),Header files add functionality to C programs.
                  blank line --C compiler ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
                  main() --It is a function(always appear in a C program), Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
                  printf()-- is a function used to output/print text to the screen.
                  ;(semicolon)-- Every C statement ends with a ;
          The body of int main() could also been written as:
                      int main(){printf("Hello World!");return 0;}

          Statements =
          A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer,these programming instructions are called "statements".
          Many Statements(Example).

C Output-
          Print Text =
          Exapmle, Double Quotes, Many printf Functions.

          New Lines =
          \n(newline character)-- It forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.
          escape sequences("\n","\t","\\","\"").
